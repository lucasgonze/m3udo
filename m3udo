Do "m3udo -h" to get a detailed help message.

m3udo

  Shell command for Unix-like operating systems to build and execute
  command lines from a template command and a list of items to insert in
  the template. Substitutes each item in the list into the template, then
  executes the combined command.

  In comparison to the xargs utility, you should find m3udo easier. In
  comparison to "for" loops in the bourne shell, you should find m3udo
  involves less typing. In comparison to hand-rolled scripts, you should
  find m3udo less buggy and more secure.

Usage

  m3udo [switches] [command] [file(s)]

  Example:
\$ echo "a
b" | m3udo "echo {} was the string" -
a was the string
b was the string

  Switches: "-r" will cause any line in the data file ending in .m3u to
  be treated as a file name to be opened and processed recursively.

  Command: a template of a shell command. Each line in the data file will
  be concatenated, and the combined string executed. If the template
  contains {}, the data will be inserted at that position instead of
  appended.

  This allows you to insert a file reference into a command somewhere
  other than at the end.

  File argument(s):
    * Any arguments after the command are assumed to be names of data
      files.
    * A file named "-" is interpreted to mean standard input.
    * Before passing a line to a command, whitespace at either end and
      DOS-fuxored carriage returns are trimmed.

  A line in the data file beginning with "#" is considered a comment and
  is skipped.

Installation

 npm install -g m3udo

  If perl is not installed in /usr/bin/perl on your system, you will need
  to change the first line of the script from #!/usr/bin/perl to
  #!/usr/local/bin/perl or wherever your perl is installed.

Examples

  m3udo ls my.m3u

  will run the ls command on each file named in my.m3u.

  m3udo wget my.m3u

  will fetch items that are HTTP urls.

  m3udo "mv {} newdir/" my.m3u

  will move items to a new directory.

  m3udo "wget {}; basename {} >> cache.m3u" my.m3u

  will fetch items that are HTTP urls and create a new playlist with
  local copies.

  m3udo ls *.m3u

  will run the ls command on each item in all m3u files.

  cat my.m3u | m3udo ls -

  will run the ls command on each item in my.m3u.

  m3udo -r ls my.m3u

  will run the ls command on each item in my.m3u, and on each item in any
  .m3u files contained in my.m3u, ad recursivitum.
    __________________________________________________________________

  m3udo is not aware that M3U files usually contain lists of audio files.
  In its view M3U is simply a standard format for batch processing --
  entries could just as well be any kind of data.

Security

  m3udo passes filenames contained within an m3u file as arguments to a
  shell command. It is possible for attackers to use shell metacharacters
  in filenames to attack your system. You can defend against this by
  inspecting the names of downloaded files before operating on them with
  m3udo.
